While his core is rooted in musical composition and production, his background in computer programming provides a rare, structural perspective that enhances his collaboration with developers and directors alike.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5,0\">Rather than being confined to a single role, Matías offers a versatile skill set that can navigate the fluid demands of a production. He is proficient in Wwise and FMOD, allowing him to speak the language of implementation while maintaining a focus on the emotional impact of the score.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"5,2\">His experience enables him to engage with the entire audio pipeline—from thematic sketching and performance to technical integration—ensuring that the final soundscape is an organic extension of the project's vision. For Wal3, audio is not just a finished file, but a dynamic element shaped by both artistic intuition and technical intelligence.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
